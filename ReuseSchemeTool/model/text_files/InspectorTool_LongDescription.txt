DESCRIPTION
The Inspector Tool represents the first/preliminary step of the Steel Reuse Scheming Process.
Its aim is to provide the user with a comprehensive overview of the existing steel assets currently present in the Revit model via a series of charts and graphics in Excel.

ALGORITHM
The Tool collects all the existing frames in the Revit model and groups them based on their section size as well as length and material.
All the collected data gets then loaded into a dedicated Excel file populated with a variety of charts and tables that allow the user to get a first
overview of the different typologies of existing frames that are present in the model.

LIMITATIONS

1. Tool compatible with all Revit versions from Revit 2020 onwards

2. All the Steel Frames must be assigned with the following Revit Parameters:
	- BHE_Material
		- Allowed Values: 
			- "Steel"
	- BHE_Reuse_Strategy
		- Allowed Values:
			- "EXISTING TO DISMANTLE - TO RECYCLE"
			- "EXISTING TO DISMANTLE - UNKNOWN"
			- "EXISTING TO REMAIN – MAKE GOOD"
	- BHE_Reuse_Rating
		- Keep this parameter empty, the tool will populate it automatically.

3. If any of the parameters above are not present in the Revit model, the user shall create them before running the tool
	- Consult the User Guide of the Tool for instructions on how to create the parameters.

4. Only Steel To-Recycle frames are considered
	- Only frames with following assigned parameters are considered by the tool
		- BHE_Material = "Steel"
		- BHE_Reuse Strategy = "EXISTING TO DISMANTLE - TO RECYCLE"

3. Naming Conventions for Revit Parameters
	- Whatever family/element doesn't abide by the following conventions, the corresponding parameter values won't be extracted from the model by the tool and won't be taken into account in the computations
	- Weight -> "Nominal Weight"
	- Length -> "Length"
