DESCRIPTION
The Scheme Tool represents the second/scheming step of the Steel Reuse Scheming Process.
Its aim is to assign a rating to the different existing steel frames in the model based on their potential for reuse based on the criteria inputs by the user.


ALGORITHM
Based on the input criteria provided by the user, the Tool rates each existing steel frame in the Revit model, serializes the data in json format, generates data
analytics and filtered 3D Views of the model within a Revit View Sheet as well as a set of dedicated Excel and PDF files that summarize the results of the scheming process.

LIMITATIONS

1. Tool compatible with all Revit versions from Revit 2020 onwards

2. All the Steel Frames must be assigned with the following Revit Parameters:
	- BHE_Material
		- Allowed Values: 
			- "Steel"
	- BHE_Reuse_Strategy
		- Allowed Values:
			- "EXISTING TO DISMANTLE - TO RECYCLE"
			- "EXISTING TO DISMANTLE - UNKNOWN"
			- "EXISTING TO REMAIN – MAKE GOOD"
	- BHE_Reuse_Rating
		- Keep this parameter empty, the tool will populate it automatically.

3. If any of the parameters above is missing, the user shall create them before running the tool
	- Consult the User Guide of the Tool for instructions on how to create the parameters.

4. Only Steel To-Recycle frames are considered
	- Only frames with following assigned parameters are considered by the tool
		- BHE_Material = "Steel"
		- BHE_Reuse Strategy = "EXISTING TO DISMANTLE - TO RECYCLE"

3. Naming Conventions for Revit Parameters
	- All families/elements have to abide by the following parameter naming conventions.
	- Weight -> "Nominal Weight"
	- Length -> "Length"
	- Area -> "Section Area" or "A"
